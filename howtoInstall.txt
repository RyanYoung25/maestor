========================================

MAESTOR depends on a few major components:

- Ros Indigo
- Openrave 
- Ach
- Hubo-ach
- OpenHubo

It is recommended that you install the dependencies in the 
order listed. 

ROS Indigo

http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu

Follow the steps on the site. They're pretty straight forward.

Openrave
========

This blog post actually gets everything installed correctly. 

Ach
======

Build from source using the repo found:

https://github.com/golems/ach

Master branch should be fine.

Run: 

sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool autoconf-archive
git clone https://github.com/golems/ach
cd ach
autoreconf -i
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic dkms openbsd-inetd help2man man2html docbook-utils avahi-utils
./configure
make
sudo make install

Steps to build the python bindings:
	- Go to ach directory
	- Go into python directory
	- Run the command: python setup.py sdist
	- Go into the dist directory
	- Run the command: sudo pip install <tarball>

** MAKE SURE PIP3 IS INSTALLED BEFORE CHECKING INSTALLATION (sudo apt-get install python3-pip) **

Check that it installed correctly by running the python interpreter and running 'import ach'

Hubo-Ach
========

Use Eric Rock's fork:

https://github.com/isaacgaretmia/hubo-ach

Checkout the 'power' branch

autoreconf -i
./configure
sudo make
sudo make install

OpenHubo
========

I need to make a fork and host the changes that I made to make everything work.
